<h1 align="center">Welcome to my Flashloan repo ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p align="center">A flash loan is a type of loan that allows someone to borrow money from a cryptocurrency platform for a very short period of time, typically just a few seconds. The unique thing about a flash loan is that the borrower doesn't need to provide any collateral or security to get the loan. They can borrow a significant amount of cryptocurrency, use it for a specific purpose (like trading or investing), and then pay it back, all within the same transaction.</p>
